Project Description
WTWR is a comprehensive application designed to help users decide what to wear based on various factors such as weather conditions, personal preferences, and occasion. The back-end component of WTWR serves as the foundation for the application's functionalities, managing data storage, user authentication, and providing a robust API for the front-end to interact with.

Key Features:
User Management: Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Clothing Item Management: Users can add, update, delete, like, and dislike clothing items.
Weather Integration: Suggests clothing items based on current weather conditions.
Secure Authorization: Implements user authentication to ensure data security.
Comprehensive API: Provides RESTful API endpoints for seamless front-end integration.
Testing and Deployment: Ensures reliability through automated testing and facilitates deployment on remote servers.

Technologies and Techniques Used:
The WTWR Back End leverages a suite of modern technologies and best practices to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable server environment.

1. Node.js & Express.js
   Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side scripting.
   Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
2. MongoDB & Mongoose
   MongoDB: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
   Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
3. Authentication & Security
   JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication and authorization.
   bcrypt: For hashing user passwords to ensure they are securely stored.
4. Linting & Formatting
   ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript, ensuring code quality.
   Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it.
5. Version Control
   Git & GitHub: For tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and maintaining the project's history.

   `npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
